This feedback is an auto-generated summary of the rating of your assignmnet according to the rubric. The assignment may have additional grading criteria, which is why your grade may diverge from the computed score. If the grader provides additional feedback, you find this at the bottom.

Readability
===========
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 8.3%

Points for improvement
----------------------
- Some names appear unreadable, meaningless, misleading and/or do not meet naming conventions.

Good points
-----------
+ Indentation conforms to the code conventions.
+ Complex lines of code are broken up in smaller, easier to understand and coherent chunks.
+ Placement of parentheses conforms to the code conventions.
+ Meaningful identifiers which meet naming conventions are used as variables, functions and class names.
+ Comments explain tricky or important decisions.

DRY principle
=============
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 8.3%

Points for improvement
----------------------

Good points
-----------
+ Helper functions are used in order to reuse code.

Flow
====
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 8.3%

Points for improvement
----------------------

Good points
-----------
+ Code order of blocks corresponds to intuition of assignment.
+ Code only branches when necessary, not when possible.
+ Nested conditionals are only used when necessary.

Correctness
===========
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 41.7%

Points for improvement
----------------------

Good points
-----------
+ The program conforms to the specifications provided by the assignment.
+ The program produces correct results for correct inputs.

Test Traceability
=================
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 16.7%

Points for improvement
----------------------

Good points
-----------
+ The creation of the context in which the tested functionality is performed is meaningful.
+ One test asserts properties of just one method.
+ The names of tests clearly describe the test cases.

Test Completeness
=================
Score        : 4 [1 (fully failed) - 4 (fully passed)]
Score weight : 16.7%

Points for improvement
----------------------

Good points
-----------
+ All specifications of the program are tested properly and sufficiently.
+ The most common path through a program is sufficiently tested.
+ All edge cases are tested for every method within the program.
+ Infrequent or exceptional paths through the program are tested sufficiently.
+ It is tested if every method that throws exceptions does indeed throw the exception in question in the correct situations.
+ The expected values in assertions are correct and strong enough. Only correct programs can pass the tests.

Grading
